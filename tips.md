title: Tip Analysis
---

As I came from a non-tipping country, I am very interested in analyzing tips of NYC so I can know how much tip is appropriate for a ride. Meanwhile, analyzing tips is also useful for city administrators and cab venodrs. It can provide them with economic information to adjust drivers' wages or cab fares in order to maximize revenue.

My Guess for factors affecting tipping are:
- **passenger's income**: if the trip ends at financial districts, we might assume the passenger are wealthy and tip more;
- **economic situation**: maybe during the covid pandemic, passengers will tip less due to the economic recession;
- **passenger's satisfaction to the trip**: a matter of course, but it seems we cannot find sufficient information from our dataset to demonstrate this;

For this project, I will first do some general analysis about the relationship between tipping and other features, then try to construct a model to predict the tip of a trip.  

## 1. ETL

### 1.1. Data Filtering
Please check [].

### 1.2. Further ETL for Tips

- **payment type = 1**:<br>
    The dataset only records tips paid by credit card.
- **Tip Ratio/Percentage**:<br>
    According to [New York Official Guide](https://www.nycgo.com/plan-your-trip/basic-information/tipping-sales-tax#:~:text=Taxi%20drivers%3A%2015%E2%80%9320%20percent,check%20staff%2C%20are%20always%20appreciated.), the tipping to cab driver should be 15â€“20 percent of total fare. So here we count the `100*tip_amount/(total_amount - tip_amount)` as the tip percent.
- **Tip Range**:<br>
    In addition tip percentage directly, I also determine the tip range to help visualize the massive data.
- **Pickup/Dropdown location**:<br>
    Locations can somehow reflect the income level of passengers.
- **Date, Year, Month**:<br>
    Necessary for analyzing tip changes over time.

## 2. General Analysis

### 2.1. Distribution of NYC Tipping Percentage

From the two bar charts, we can see yellow cab passengers tip more than green cab passengers. Quite a few green cab passengers do not tip. This confirms our hypothesis that tipping is related to the income level of the passenger, as yellow cabs operate mainly in busy urban areas, while green cabs, introduced in 2011, operate in areas not served by yellow cabs.

We can also see that for yellow cabs, although the number of trips dropped significantly in 2020 due to the explosion of covid, the distribution of tipping remain. Most passengers tip 15 to 20 percent to a trip. So we can say that the economics situation has little affect on tipping.

### 2.2. Tips and Locations


## 3. Predicting Tips
Now let's try to construct models and see if we can predict the tips.
### 3.1. Feature Engineering

### 3.2. Regression Model

model | Evaluation Score | TOP 2 important features
-| - 
DecisionTree | r2 = 0.0427<br>rmse = 6.5653 | other_amount: 0.8204, fare_amount:0.17484
RandomForest | r2 = 0.0474<br> rmse = 6.5468 | dd
Gradient Boosted Tree | r2 = 0.0427<br>rmse = 6.5653 | other_amount: 0.8204, fare_amount:0.17484

Regerssion models all have poor performance predicting the tip percent. What about predicting the tip range instead of directly predicting the precise tip percent?

### 3.3. Classification Model
model | Evaluation Score | TOP 2 important features
-| - 
DecisionTree | accuracy=0.5977 | other_amount: ,0.58494, fare_amount: 0.3066
RandomForest | r2 = 0.5224|  other_amount: 0.66576, fare_amount: .3144

The performance of classification models are not ideal neither. It seems we do not have sufficient data to predict tip.
